Description

The driving question behind this research project seeks to explore What is something that is important to your community that can and should be shared in a music classroom? This project aims to collect content, themes, musical ideas and experiences from a variety of authentic cultural sources to make the research of musical diversity more accessible for educators, to allow community leaders to showcase important and exciting content from their chosen communities, and to provide quick access between community leaders and classrooms. All with the aspirations for community collaboration and diverse learning in the music classroom. 

For the purpose of this project, the following statements will remain true;
A Leader is a person/s who identifies as having a leadership role within their identified community
A Lesson is an idea, concept, teachable moment, or detailed plan for acquiring, understanding, and/or practicing learning
An Educator is a leader within a formal (public or private) institution who teaches a scheduled classroom of learners

This project aspires to create an online community where leaders of communities (educators, chiefs, elders, clan leaders, priests, politicians, artisans etc.)  contribute music/musical ideas to a fluid database of important teaching about the communities they identify with. Anyone can create lessons or activities to teach/reinforce a musical idea from their identified culture and all contributors will have access to the final product. Leaders can contribute in two formats; A database of artists showcasing their communities and availability for outreach opportunities AND/OR sharable lessons from their communities to enhance an educators resource list.

Contributors wonâ€™t need to create full lesson plans as educators should have the ability to adapt the delivery of information based on their group of learners, however, lessons will be offered in a fashion that outlines how to explain/practice the concept or where to find authentically sourced information. It will also provide the opportunity for contributors to offer their contact information for open discussion between leader and educator pertaining to their offered concepts and/or to create community connections between the leader and classroom. 

Format & Requirements

The project will be outlined, researched and theorized in a Word document, supported by a poster advertising campaign (Posters, Facebook ad campaign etc.) and followed by Google forms for contributor submissions. Contributions will be vetted before publishing and submissions will be made public in an uneditable format. 

Contributors and users of this project will need a basic understanding of the English language, an internet connection, and Google Forms.

Planned Outcomes of the Project

Community members will be able to contribute to the content presented in schools.
Educators will be able to access culturally cognisant lesson information and establish community connections to support the lesson and their learners' engagement with concepts/content. 
Educators will benefit from access to a variety of culturally diverse concepts.
Learners will benefit from the value of diverse content, community connection, and social awareness.

 Methodology

Students should be exposed to diverse learning styles, content, and approach in order to become rounded and informed contributors to society. This project encourages educators to adapt their methodologies to include more diverse student-focused pedagogy through a process-based approach. With the ability to pull information from this database, educators can connect with local and global communities while adapting lessons to the needs of the students. This project provides resources and information that can be revisited, and reviewed in a variety of formats. 

As per the four pillars of learning, this project will demonstrate spiral learning as concepts can and should be approached/revisited with new perspectives at multiple stages of learning as well as through demonstration of the growth of a musical learner; educators teach learners who become contributors who become/aid educators who continue the cycle. The project will pursue artistry through;
Contributors sharing their passion
Educators' ability to creatively select material
Learners' exposure to a wide variety of cultures and cultural music
Educators and learners experiencing contributors in their element

Vetting Submissions & Security

All submissions will be reviewed before they are made public. This may be done in the form of research and/or conversation about the topic with the contributor to confirm there are no ill intentions. Vetting will be done by Kate Gillis and will expand to a jury as the project grows. If you would like to join the jury for this project please contact Kate Gillis, katelyn.a.gillis@gmail.com

Obtaining Resources

Vetted material will be shared with you and/or people wishing to view this resource may request access. In requesting access you agree to the following statements;
You will not change any of the contributors' words. You may modify ideas and themes for your learners but must reference all source materials in their original form
Lessons will be presented with as much authenticity as possible. 
Lessons will include reference to this project and how to contribute to it. 

How to Use the Collected Data

Assessors of this project can adapt the delivery of information based on their group of learners, however, lessons are offered in a fashion that outlines how to explain/practice the concept and/or where to find authentically sourced information. Contributors are also offered the opportunity to provide their contact information for open discussion between leader and educator about their offered concepts and/or to create community connections and experiences between the leader and classroom. 

This project was imagined with the hopes of connecting classrooms with unlikely local talent. If you are aware of an educator, community leader, or cultural advocate that would benefit from involvement, please connect them with the contributor forms.
